Breast Cancer Predicted with Naive Bayes

# Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes classifiers are supervised machine learning algorithms used for classification tasks, based on Bayes’ Theorem to find probabilities.

# Key Features of Naive Bayes Classifiers
The main idea behind the Naive Bayes classifier is to use Bayes’ Theorem to classify data based on the probabilities of different classes given the features of the data. It is used mostly in high-dimensional text classification

  - The Naive Bayes Classifier is a simple probabilistic classifier and it has very few number of parameters which are used to build the ML models that can predict at a faster speed than other classification algorithms.
  - It is a probabilistic classifier because it assumes that one feature in the model is independent of existence of another feature. In other words, each feature contributes to the predictions with no relation between each other.
  - Naïve Bayes Algorithm is used in spam filtration, Sentimental analysis, classifying articles and many more.

# About the dataset 
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nhatnguyenhoangbao/breast-cancer

This file appears to contain breast cancer diagnostic data. It includes 569 rows and 32 columns, where each row represents a tumor sample with various measured features.

The 32 features are:
  - Serial Number (The number of patients)
  - Continious variables: Mean of many features (Radius, Texture, Perimeter, Area, Smoothness, Compactness,...)
  - Categorical variable: Output (Benign/Malignant)

Dataset Overview

  - The dataset contains no missing values (all columns have 569 non-null entries).
  - The features are continuous numerical values.
  - The target variable is binary (Benign (B)/Malignant (M)).
